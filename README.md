# Hi there! 👋

## About Me
I'm a 16-year-old student from Switzerland 🇨🇭 with a passion for programming, math, and physics. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and science, especially in areas like **quantum computing**, **machine learning**, and **gesture recognition**. 

### A Bit More About Me:
- 🖥️ **Programming Experience**: I have **1.5 years of general programming experience**, primarily in Python, with some knowledge of C and C++.
- 🔬 **Current Projects**: 
  - Developing a **gesture-controlled quadcopter** using a Raspberry Pi 5 and AI-powered gesture recognition. 🚁
  - Exploring advanced topics in **neural networks** and **agent-based simulations**.
- 📚 **Education**: 
  - I'm studying math and science at an advanced level and attend a university-level stochastic course every Saturday.
  - My math teacher allows me to work on **AI projects** during class, which I truly enjoy.
- 🌌 **Fun Facts**: I love christmas cookies, tennis and hanging out with my friends!

## Goals
I aspire to make an impact in the field of **quantum computing** and explore innovative applications of AI and robotics.
