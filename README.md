# Hi there! 👋

## About Me
I'm a 17-year-old student from Switzerland 🇨🇭 with a passion for programming, math, and physics. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and science — especially in areas like **quantum computing**, **machine learning**, and **quant finance**.

### A Bit More About Me:
- 🖥️ **Programming Experience**: I have **2 years of general programming experience**, primarily in Python, with some knowledge of C, C++, C#, and basic Web Developement skills.
- 🔬 **Current Projects**:  
  I'm currently working through the books **Deep Learning – Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville** and **The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance – Mark S. Joshi**, with the goal of deeply understanding the theory and implementing key ideas in code.
- 📚 **Education**:  
  I’m currently in the second year of Swiss gymnasium (high school), but I'm already about **1.5 years ahead** of the schedule in mathematics.  
  My math teacher allows me to work on **AI projects** during class, which I truly enjoy.

### 🔍 Academic Enrichment
I've participated in several **university-level STEM programs** for highly motivated students:

- 🧪 **Early Studies in Stochastics and Combinatorics** at the University of Zurich
- 🧪 **Early Studies in Vector - and Complex Calculus** at the University of Zurich  
- 🌌 **UZH Masterclass in Particle Physics**  
- 🧮 **ETH Zurich Study Week** in Mathematics

These experiences allowed me to explore advanced topics, collaborate with researchers, and gain early exposure to real-world scientific problems.

- 🎾 **Fun Facts**: I love Christmas cookies, tennis, and spending time with friends!

## Goals
I aspire to make an impact in the field of **quantum computing**, and explore innovative applications of **AI and mathematics** in science and industry.
